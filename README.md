This project combines the power of two advanced models—YOLO for object detection and Qwen for image captioning and information extraction—to identify products in an image and extract key details about them. The application provides a user-friendly interface using Gradio, allowing users to upload images and receive annotated outputs with detailed product information.

# To run the code for product descripter, follow these steps: 

Run infrence_Final_UI.ipynb.
Load the YOLO and QWEEN models.
Execute the last block in the notebook to launch the Gradio interface for uploading images.

# To run the code for freshness, follow these steps: 

Run infrence_final_freshness_UI.ipynb.
Load the YOLO and QWEEN models.
Execute the last block in the notebook to launch the Gradio interface for uploading images.

# To run the code for video input, follow these steps: 

Run video_ifrence_final_UI.ipynb.
Load the YOLO and QWEEN models.
Execute the last block in the notebook to launch the Gradio interface for uploading images.
